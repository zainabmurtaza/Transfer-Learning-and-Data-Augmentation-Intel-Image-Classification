Awarded first place for Intel Image Classification, this solution used Transfer Learning, Progressive Image Resizing used Keras architecture ResNet50 [1]. 
Those pre-trained ImageNet weights were trained on a model with images incrementally increasing in size. 
We used DenseNet121, and did pretty much the same thing (pertaining to default image transformation, batch normalization and learning rate optimizer). 
Their test accuracy was 94%. However, they also used Places365 Dataset Weights for ResNet50 transfer learning and attained test accuracy of 95%. 

kNN with Embeddings was another approach that they took, 
and is commonly described as the representation of images via feature vectors which is predominantly the model's last layer output before softmax activation 
(also known as few-shot learning). 

Test Time Augmentation was also another approach that they used. 
This method consitutes more or less of the same mechanism as Data Augmentation, the difference being that augmented images are shown to the model several times[2]. 
The predictions of each corresponding image are then averaged, and that is proclaimed the final guess. 

In terms of test performance, in this assignment we managed to achieve a test accuracy of 90% compared to the maximum achieved by the researched winning model which was 95%. 
We used DenseNet primarily because each layer in the network received additional input from its preceding layers and henceforth all subsequent layers received said DenseNet feature maps. 
This results in a network that has a fewer number of channels, resulting in enhanced computing efficiency[3]. 

Additionally (and in contrast to typical ResNet versions), for our model, DenseNet121 ensures that there is no vanishing-gradient, enhances feature propagation, enables the re-use of features, and largely cuts back on the number of parameters[4]. 

The list of approaches mentioned above are only some of the myriad ways that many people have approached the Intel Image Classification problem.
